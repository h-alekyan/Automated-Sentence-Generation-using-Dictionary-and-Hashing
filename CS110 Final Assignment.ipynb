    "# CS110 Final Assignment\n",
    "## Automated Sentence Generation using Dictionary and Hashing \n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, I will create a simple autocomplete bot that generates sentences. The bot will take an initial string with n number of words as well as a word count parameter wordcount and produce a text with the given word count. The motivation for this project is the fact that autogenerated texts can be used in a variety of fields, from fillers to SEO rank boosting content. In addition to that, many applications use autocompletion to help people type faster by suggesting the most relevant word in a given context.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Python dictionary and custom hash tables because these data structures are highly relevant for our purpose. They allow an easy, fast, and efficient mapping between keys and values. For a dictionary, a single mapping takes $O(1)$ time, and finding a value given the key also takes $O(1)$ time. Which is great, since our generator is going to constantly and iteratively find values given a key. I looked into the resource provided by prof. Ribeiro in my proposal feedback, and concluded that my algorithm is very much similar to an n-gram model. In this case, we will have a prefix (two words) as a key and a list of words as a value. For any given prefix, the algorithm will find the appropriate slot where the key is the prefix and then will access the value, which is a list. Inside this list is the pool of all the words that appeared after the given prefix in our original text (\"The World as Will and Representation\" by Arthur Schopenhauer). The algorithm will randomly take a word from the list and add it to our generated text. Since the sampling is done randomly, the words that appeared more in the original text have higher chances of being sampled; therefore, more relevant words will be suggested for a given prefix. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "We will need to define some criteria for our context to decide which algorithmic solution is better. \n",
    "The first criterion will be time complexity. We want to find a solution that is fast, and the runtime does not grow at a high rate as the input (a word bank with n number of words) increases. This is very important since n-grams can take up a lot of space and time to store all the data if the given original text is too large.\n",
    "The second criterion will be the syntax. We want the generated text to be somewhat \"good,\" meaning, syntactically, somewhat correct. We will consider an output text good if any given pair of words is syntactically correct. Meaning the sentence \"this is the suffering which is merely known\" is a good sentence since if we take any two consecutive words (i.e., \"this is\" or \" merely known\"), the resulting phrase is acceptable. On the other hand, \"this is the the suffering which is merely known\" is not a good sentence since \"the the\" is not correct.   \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "I will also put a lot of focus on using Python classes for this assignment. Firstly, I want to improve my OOP skills and get more used to working with classes and class objects. The second reason is that the bot can be further improved, and new features can be added (which I will also discuss later). Having a Generator and Hashtable classes makes it easier to expand on the existing features and add new attributes/methods that can interact with the existing ones or use the existing features. Furthermore, we might want to have several different hashtable or generator instances, and having a class makes it extremely easy to create such instances with a single line of code."

    "Although the algorithm successfully generates text, I am not very happy with its' performance. If we pay attention we can see that our generator with custom hash table makes more syntactic mistakes than the one with dictionary. This is because we have a limited number of slots and words that follow different tuples are in the same slot. Which means that in a short time our generator creates a pair of words that did not exist in the original text (therefore higher chances of mistakes). Furthermore, if we did not have the try and except handler, our code would very quickly crash since it would face a tuple of words that does not exist in the original text. We can fix this by creating slots inside a slot and putting a given 3rd word into the sublist of the appropriate prefix. We will create the second CustomHashTable, which will have these improvements."

One reason why we have such load factor is our hash function. I choose the specific hash function because it can produce a large amounth of unique values. Furthermore, I knew that I was going to concatinate two words into a single string. This means that the shortest possible string in the text would have at least 3 characters (for example \"is a\" = \"isa\"), this would imply $26^3$ unique values for a string with length 3. However, we know that the average length of a string will be much longer (about 10-15 characters), which means we will have a very large number of unique keys generated. This lowers the chances of collisions. \n",

As a result, our generator that uses the first hash function will make up new word tuples that did not exist in the original text, including ones that we consider syntactically bad. This is why the second hash table is more handy than the first one. Since we cannot escape these collisions, we will try to search inside a slot for the subslot where our desired prefix is. This might take a bit more time, but we are ok with this cost for now since we care about syntax too. (As of now, on average we will make 2 comparisons in a given slot, but we should note that this number grows linearly with the size of word bank input). \n",

    "As we can see, the generator with a built-in python dictionary performs much faster than the one working with the CustomHashTable2 class (not only is it higher, but also seems to have a sharper growth). Let's start by noting that, on average, a python dictionary takes $O(1)$ time to find a value given the key. For our hashmap however, it will take more time since our algorithm finds the slot where the key-value pair is, but then performs a search inside the slot to find the pair since every slot can have more than one key-value pair. Furthermore, our function searches using a simple for loop, which is not the best searching strategy. However, due to the small load factor, we know that the pool of search will be much smaller (for our current input, it will take 2 or 3 comparisons on average). However, we know that the load factor depends on the number of input entries and that they grow linearly. If we assume that on average, for\n",
    "$N$ entries, $k$ number of slots will become busy, we can interpret our load factor $a$ as $\\frac{N}{k}$. Therefore, with a word bank of $N$ words as an input, it will take $O(\\frac{1}{k}N)$ time to insert all of those into the table. For Big-O notation, we ignore the coefficient, which means that the complexity will be $O(N)$. Since we do a similar search when using the find() method. The same analysis applies to lookup as well, which also has a time complexity of $O(N)$. \n",

    "This is not a very good performance for a hash table, especially when we know that our first hash table would perform insertion at a constant $O(1)$ speed. However, again, in comparison to Hashtable 1, Hashtable 2 better preserves a good syntax, which in our context is very important. On the other hand, a python dictionary is able to both perform insertion and lookup at a constant time while also preserving the desired syntactic structure. We can also note that the worst case scenario for a built-in Python dictionary is highly unlikely, but if we were to theorise one, the complexity would be $O(N)$ since python dictionaries also use hashmaping.\n",

    "We conclude that a native python dictionary wins this \"race.\" It satisfies all of our criteria: it is fast and efficient and produces syntactically good results. However, we were able to get very important insights about how hash tables can be used for our purpose. We also found practical ways of modifying hash tables to accommodate our needs. One thing that I find very interesting is that even a small in-slot search function was able to move the complexity up from constant to $O(N)$, which is amusing and tells a lot about how careful we should be even with small modifications. I have also made several attempts to overcome the linear growth of my second hash table class, which, unfortunately, did not work well enough. One example is my attempt at Cuckoo hashing. The cuckoo hashing could be a good strategy in our case since it would take constant $O(3)$ time for both average and worst-case scenarios since we would store every key-value pair in 3 different locations, and when performing a lookup, we would only look on those 3 locations to find it. The drawback of this strategy was the possibility of having an infinite loop, which I tried to overcome with conditional handling. The reason cuckoo hashing did not work is that the conditional handler affected the quality of the output for edge cases (it would fail to output many valid inputs since there were too many recursions and the handler stopped the function).

Then I analyzed the performance and efficiency of the algorithm while also discussing the hash function and its efficiency by considering the load factor and the search processes inside the algorithms. Finally, I made two important comparisons: one between the two hashtable classes, and one between the second hash table class and the built in python dictionary. Through experimentation, I showed that a built-in python dictionary outperformed our hash table class in terms of speed and time complexity.\n",
